Description: This directory contains the simulation files for simulating a set of coupled inductors with one of them energized by a 24V dc supply and the other feeding a resistor.

Circuit schematics:
test_ckt.csv with parameters in test_ckt_params.csv
load.csv with parameters in load_params.csv
coupled_inductors.csv with parameters in:
	Option 1: coupled_inductors_assisting_params.csv for coupled coils wound such that fluxes assist.
	Option 2: coupled_inductors_opposing_params.csv for coupled coils wound such that fluxes oppose.


Control files
Only one control file is needed from the following two options.
Option 1:
magnetic_coupling_model.py with control variables in magnetic_coupling_model_desc.csv - this solves coupled inductors as a matrix equation
Option 2:
magnetic_coupling_model_simultaneous_eqns.py with control variables in magnetic_coupling_model_simultaneous_eqns_desc.py - this solves the magnetic equations as simultaneous equations.


Additional files:
triangularization.py - this file describes the concept of converting a matrix to upper triangular form.


Will generate:

ckt_output.dat (default simulator output file)
