Each folder contains simulations for a chapter. Within each folder, every simulation has a separate folder. The simulations can be run using the free and open source circuit simulation Python Power Electronics. Check out the homepage of the project: <br />

In each folder of a simulation, there will be a README file which will describe what the simulation does and also the files used by the simulation. A simulation will have:
- Circuit schematic files (.csv)
- Circuit schematic parameter files (_params.csv)
- Control files (.py)
- Control variable descriptor file (_desc.csv)

The README file will describe the different files used by the simulation and also optional files that can be used to simulate different scenarios. <br />
